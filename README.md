Face detection uses TensorFlow.js [Facemesh](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/facemesh).

## Inspired by:

Olivia Jack's [hydra](https://github.com/ojack/hydra)

Shawn Lawson's [The_Force](https://github.com/shawnlawson/The_Force) (this tool is where I first learned to write shaders!)

Myron Krueger's [Videoplace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqZyZrN3Pl0)

Community of [Shadertoy](https://shadertoy.com)

macOS [Photo Booth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_Booth)

It's also motivated by a frustration with owned creative ecosystems, like Spark AR instagram filters!
